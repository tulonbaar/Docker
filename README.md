# Introduction
This repository is used to store and manage start-up projects for applications on the Docker platform. I intend to adapt most of them to Docker Swarm needs.

# Repository
The repository is divided into folders by application and version. The folder described as swarm is intended for storing configuration files for use with Docker Swarm.

# Scripts
I add all the scripts I use to prepare and start applications to the solutions. The scripts are located in the scripts folder.
